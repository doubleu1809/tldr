# sdiff

>  Compares two files to find differances and interactivly merges them. Without the -o option, sdiff behaves like diff-side-by-side.

- For example the command:

sdiff-a
- Treat all files as text files. Useful for checking to see if binary files are identical.

sdiff-b
- Ignore repeating blanks and end-of-line blanks; treat successive blanks as one.

sdiff-B
- Ignore blank lines in files.

sdiff-d
- Ignore segments of numerous changes and output a smaller set of changes.

sdiff-H
- Speed output of large files by scanning for scattered small changes; long stretches with many changes may not show up.
